/**
 * Get k-sized combinations of elements in a set.
 *
 * Usage: `combinations(set, k)`
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], 1)
 *   -> [[1], [2], [3]]
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], 2)
 *   -> [[1,2], [1,3], [2, 3]]
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], 3)
 *   -> [[1, 2, 3]]
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], 4)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], 0)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   combinations([1, 2, 3], -1)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   combinations([], 0)
 *   -> []
 *
 *
 * @param {Array} set - Array of objects of any type. They are treated as unique.
 * @param {Number} k - size of combinations to search for.
 * @returns {Array} - Array of found combinations; the size of a combination is k.
